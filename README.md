# Odin Recipes

This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. It involves creating a simple website for recipes using HTML. The skills demonstrated in this project include:

- Creating and structuring HTML files
- Using Git for version control
- Writing clear and informative README files

By the end of this project, I will have a solid understanding of basic HTML structure and Git workflows.
